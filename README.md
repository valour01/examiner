# EXAMINER
A framework  that can automatically locate inconsistent instructions between real devices and emulators for ARM

`test-generator` is based on the [mra-tools](https://github.com/alastairreid/mra_tools), where you can find all the dependencies.

`diff-engine` is for testing each single instruction stream. 

We are now refactoring the code for a more clean release.
